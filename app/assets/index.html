		<h3>Skills</h3>
		Technical leader with an interest in finding the right
solution for the problem at hand. I aim for user and product empathy and breadth
of knowledge, combined with ability to select the best individuals for in-depth
knowledge of necessary topics. I have over 10 years of experience in building
REST APIs, cross platform software architecture, scaling systems to meet demand and
managing the costs of building and running those systems.
My ideal challenge requires a mix of something I know well, for example,
architecture of large scale applications, API development and team organization
with a product I am eager to improve.
